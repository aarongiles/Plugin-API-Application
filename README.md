# Plugin API/Application
gradlew run does not work, instead, the easiest way to run this isjust going into the build folder and running the class file Evauluator
and it works fine.


Once the program is running you can add plugins by typing 'plugin CSVPlugin' for example
Be sure to make sure it is spelt correctly, there is no real validation of this except a try catch
You can see what is installed by typing 'list' or 'clear' to clear
You can see it is saved in plugins.txt...
With the csv plugin it is saved to data.csv
